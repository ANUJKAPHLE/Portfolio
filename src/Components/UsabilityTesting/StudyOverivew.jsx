            For this usability testing study, we will recruit eight
            participants: two HR managers, two HR assistants, and four regular
            employees, ensuring a balanced mix of experience levels and
            technical proficiency. Participants will perform essential HR tasks,
            including logging in, navigating the dashboard, updating employee
            information, processing leave requests, managing payroll, and
            conducting performance evaluations. We will collect data through
            observations, think-aloud protocols, surveys, and interviews.
